In today's world, facial recognition is becoming more common. it is a way of recognizing a human face through technology. A facial recognition system uses biometrics to map facial features from a photograph or video. In terms of security, it has made significant strides. It's a powerful tool that can aid law enforcement in identifying criminals, and software companies are exploiting the technology to make it easier for people to access it. A facial recognition software captures and compares patterns on a person’s face and analyses the details to identify and verify the individual. While the underlying system is complex, the whole technology can be broken down into three steps: 

1.	Face Detection: An essential step is locating human faces in real-time
2.	Transform Data: Once captured, the analogue facial information is transformed into a set of data or vectors based on a person’s facial features
3.	Face Match: The system matches the data above with the one in the database for verification
